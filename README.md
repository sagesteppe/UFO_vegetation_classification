# UFO_vegetation_classification

The use of GAP data sets were strongly encouraged by the NOC at the initial sample design steps of many/most AIM projects. While this dataset has fantastic groundtruthing, it relies on spatial data products from satellites which are inadequate for many of the classification problems in heterogenous landscapes. Our sample design included 8 strata, however the points which fell in many/most of these strata were inaccurately labelled. We both showcase the logic and implemetation for:

- post stratifying the plots via manual classification in google earth, or k-means clustering
- reallocating the acreage for areas of inference to more common groups
- we achieve this using widely avaiable datasets which may be rendered on computers of powers which are on occasion available. Do reach out if you are in the bureau and require some computations to be performed
